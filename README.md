# AI-Predictive-Maintenance
This project implements an AI-based predictive maintenance system for military vehicles using machine learning. It predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of vehicles based on sensor data, helping to anticipate failures, improve operational efficiency, and reduce maintenance costs. 
The project leverages Random Forest Regressor, a machine learning model, to predict RUL from sensor data. The model is deployed via an interactive Streamlit web app, enabling military personnel or maintenance staff to input real-time data and receive predictions on vehicle health.
This project utilizes Python to build an AI-based predictive maintenance system. The model is trained using Scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library, and deployed via an interactive web app built with Streamlit. The trained model is saved using joblib for easy reuse and future predictions.
This project is focused on AI-based predictive maintenance for military vehicles, providing a streamlined process for users to make predictions about the remaining useful life of a vehicle. It emphasizes the use of machine learning to help enhance operational readiness.
