# AI-Predictive-Maintenance
This project implements an AI-based predictive maintenance system for military vehicles using machine learning. It predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of vehicles based on sensor data, helping to anticipate failures, improve operational efficiency, and reduce maintenance costs.
